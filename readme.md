This is the first API project built while a boot camp student. Built in my second week of camp, the .py file also includes my future to-do list of possible enhancements.

##Why I Built This:##
I know how to get to and from work. So I don't turn on my navigation. It would be extra work.

But every so often my "usual" route has an unexpected accident, or traffic jam. I thought to myself, "I wish I didn't have to run navigation every day just to avoid the rare traffic jam."

And the idea was born. A system that houses my "usual" route home. Each day at 5pm (currently requires manual file running) it checks the "usual" route's estimated time against the "best available" route, only generating an SMS notification if the time savings surpasses my defined threshold. I don't run navigation... unless I get a message.
