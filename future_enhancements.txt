FUTURE PROJECT ENHANCEMENTS, TO DO LIST:

- how to get bool to recognize "False" from the csv file as falsey.

- does it need error handling if 1 speciifc request fails from Google, or will it just roll to the next?

- am I looking at UTC or EST times when I send to google  https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/intro#optional-parameters
need to add computation for this?
best package for timezones: pytz?

- migrate from csv to db.

- Website to sign up/google places api to find the google place id for each user's origin and destination

- only 25 waypoints allowed (beyond origin and destination), how to work around?
remove the smallest mileage segments, with the assumption that will affect the routing the least
in jacob's case, it might have made a difference though
test pushing more than 23 waypoints to google

- Geofence to send alert when you leave that address, if between specific hours
